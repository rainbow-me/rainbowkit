## 0.2.11

### Patch Changes

- d73b021: Updated wagmi to `~1.4.13` and viem to `~1.21.4`.

## 0.2.10

### Patch Changes

- e50727f4: Updated wagmi to `~1.4.12` and viem to `~1.19.15`.

  Wagmi `1.4.12` mitigates a supply-chain attack on the @ledgerhq/connect-kit package. RainbowKit dApp's were not directly impacted, but dApps that used the LedgerConnector connector in earlier versions of Wagmi could have been. This issue has since been resolved by Ledger but the wagmi team is encouraging developers to upgrade Wagmi and RainbowKit out of an abundance of caution.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 86a1ddd: Upgraded templates to support Next 13

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 371c988: Adopted `fs`, `net`, and `tls` polyfills in the `@rainbow-me/create-rainbowkit` templates for better `wagmi@1` and `viem` Webpack bundler support.

  These modules are required by WalletConnect packages upstream, and were previously polyfilled by `ethers`. Reference the discussion [here](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/wagmi/issues/2300#issuecomment-1541425648).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 93b58d0: RainbowKit and the [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) peer dependency have been updated to `1.x.x`, which includes [breaking changes](https://wagmi.sh/react/migration-guide#1xx-breaking-changes).

  wagmi v1 now relies on `viem` instead of the `ethers` peer dependency, so `@rainbow-me/create-rainbowkit` templates have been upgraded to favor [viem](https://viem.sh/).

  Give RainbowKit and [wagmi v1](https://wagmi.sh/react/migration-guide#1xx-breaking-changes) a try today:

  ```bash
  yarn create @rainbow-me/rainbowkit
  ```

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6e25576: Update `wagmi` dependency to `^0.5.3`

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- fd5e8e7: Fix npm user agent detection

  We try to detect the package manager being used for the init/create script but we were failing to detect npm correctly, instead falling through to using `pnpm`, `yarn` or `npm` (in that order) depending on availability. The logic for detecting npm has now been fixed.

- fd5e8e7: Fix install step in Yarn

  The `install` command for `@rainbow-me/create-rainbowkit` was failing when using `yarn create` because Yarn uses `add` instead of `install`, so we now use the correct command when Yarn is detected.
