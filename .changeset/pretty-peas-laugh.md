Add `ethers` to peer dependencies to ensure consistent versioning with wagmi

We previously had a direct dependency on `@ethersproject/providers`, but this meant that provider instances generated by RainbowKit could potentially clash with the version of Ethers.js installed alongside wagmi. To avoid this, weâ€™re now relying on the `ethers` peer dependency that wagmi already requires, ensuring that there's only ever a single copy of `ethers` between them.
