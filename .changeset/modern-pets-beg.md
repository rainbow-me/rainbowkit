'@rainbow-me/rainbowkit': patch
---

Improved warnings and error handling for dApps with an invalid or missing `projectId`.

Improved the developer experience for RainbowKit examples and templates with a bundled development `projectId`. It is required that every dApp obtains a unique `projectId` before entering production to avoid throttling and issues for end users.
