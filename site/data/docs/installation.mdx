# Installation

## Get up and running with RainbowKit

### Quick start

You can scaffold a new RainbowKit + [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app with one of the following commands, using your package manager of choice:

```bash
npm init @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest
# or
pnpm create @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest
# or
yarn create @rainbow-me/rainbowkit
```

This will prompt you for a project name, generate a new directory containing a boilerplate project, and install all required dependencies.

Alternatively, you can manually integrate RainbowKit into your existing project.

### Manual setup

Install RainbowKit and its peer dependencies, [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) and [viem](https://viem.sh).

```bash
npm install @rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi viem
```

> Note: RainbowKit is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) library.

#### Import

Import RainbowKit and wagmi.

```tsx
import '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/styles.css';

import {
  getDefaultWallets,
  RainbowKitProvider,
} from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { configureChains, createConfig, WagmiConfig } from 'wagmi';
import {
  mainnet,
  polygon,
  optimism,
  arbitrum,
  zora,
} from 'wagmi/chains';
import { alchemyProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/alchemy';
import { publicProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/public';
```

#### Configure

Configure your desired chains and generate the required connectors. You will also need to setup a `wagmi` config.

> Note: Every dApp that relies on WalletConnect now needs to obtain a `projectId` from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/). This is absolutely free and only takes a few minutes.

```tsx line=4-99
...
import { alchemyProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/alchemy';
import { publicProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/public';

const { chains, publicClient } = configureChains(
  [mainnet, polygon, optimism, arbitrum, zora],
  [
    alchemyProvider({ apiKey: process.env.ALCHEMY_ID }),
    publicProvider()
  ]
);

const { connectors } = getDefaultWallets({
  appName: 'My RainbowKit App',
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  chains
});

const wagmiConfig = createConfig({
  autoConnect: true,
  connectors,
  publicClient
})
```

[Read more about configuring chains & providers with `wagmi`](https://wagmi.sh/docs/providers/configuring-chains).

#### Wrap providers

Wrap your application with `RainbowKitProvider` and [`WagmiConfig`](https://wagmi.sh/docs/provider).

```tsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <WagmiConfig config={wagmiConfig}>
      <RainbowKitProvider chains={chains}>
        <YourApp />
      </RainbowKitProvider>
    </WagmiConfig>
  );
};
```

#### Add the connect button

Then, in your app, import and render the `ConnectButton` component.

```tsx
import { ConnectButton } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';

export const YourApp = () => {
  return <ConnectButton />;
};
```

RainbowKit will now handle your user's wallet selection, display wallet/transaction information and handle network/wallet switching.

#### Additional build tooling setup

Some build tools will require additional setup.

##### React, Next.js, and Webpack

The [Webpack v5](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/) bundler used by Next.js and Create React App [no longer provides Node polyfills](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/#automatic-nodejs-polyfills-removed), so you'll need to include these modules yourself to satisfy RainbowKit's peer dependencies. Create React App specifically requires that you polyfill `Buffer`.

In previous versions of RainbowKit that relied on [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/), the `fs`, `net`, and `tls` modules were automatically polyfilled. This is no longer the case with RainbowKit v1 + wagmi v1, which are built on [viem](https://viem.sh/).

Reference our [Next.js Webpack Config](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/blob/main/examples/with-next/next.config.js) and [Create React App polyfills](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/blob/main/examples/with-create-react-app/src/polyfills.ts) samples for configuration guidance for your project.

##### Vite

The [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) bundler doesn't provide Node polyfills, so you'll need to include polyfills for `global`, `Buffer` and `process.env`. As an example, you can reference the [polyfills in our sample Vite project](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/examples/with-vite/src/polyfills.ts).

##### Remix

When using [Remix](https://remix.run), all RainbowKit package entry points must be added to your list of [server dependencies](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/pages/gotchas#importing-esm-packages) in your Remix config since they're published as ESM packages.

Remix also requires that you polyfill `global`, `Buffer` and `process.env`. Reference the [polyfills in our sample Remix project](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/blob/main/examples/with-remix/app/polyfills.ts).

```js
/**
 * @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig}
 */
module.exports = {
  serverDependencies: [
    '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit',
    '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/wallets',
  ],
};
```

### Add your own functionality

Now that your users can connect their wallets, you can start building out the rest of your app using [wagmi.](https://wagmi.sh)

Send transactions, interact with contracts, resolve ENS details and much more with wagmiâ€™s comprehensive suite of React Hooks.

For more detail, view the [wagmi documentation.](https://wagmi.sh)
