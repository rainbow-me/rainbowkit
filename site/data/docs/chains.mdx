# Chains

## Customizing chains

The `chains` prop on `RainbowKitProvider` defines which chains are available for the user to select.

Your chain config is defined in your [API Provider](/docs/api-providers) which gives you back a set of `chains` to pass through to `RainbowKitProvider`.

In the example below, we are using the Alchemy API Provider, but you can choose [another one](/docs/api-providers) if you prefer.

```tsx
import { RainbowKitProvider } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { chain } from 'wagmi';

const { chains } = apiProvider.alchemy(
  [chain.mainnet, chain.polygon],
  process.env.ALCHEMY_ID,
);

const App = () => {
  return (
    <RainbowKitProvider chains={chains} {...etc}>
      {/* ... */}
    </RainbowKitProvider>
  );
};
```

Several chain icons are provided by default, but you can customize the icon for each chain using the iconUrl property.

```tsx
const { chains } = apiProvider.alchemy(
  [
    {
      ...chain.mainnet,
      iconUrl: 'https://example.com/icons/ethereum.png',
    },
    {
      ...chain.polygon,
      iconUrl: 'https://example.com/icons/polygon.png',
    },
  ],
  process.env.ALCHEMY_ID,
);
```
