# WalletButton

> Note: The `WalletButton` currently relies on the EIP-1193 wallet standard, but will support EIP-6963 in the near future.

The new `WalletButton` component helps dApps with custom wallet list implementations adopt RainbowKit and all of it's maintenance-free benefits.

```tsx
import { WalletButton } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';

<WalletButton wallet="rainbow" />
<WalletButton wallet="metamask" />
<WalletButton wallet="coinbase" />
```

Like the `ConnectButton`, the `WalletButton.Custom` component is available for custom implementations and styling.

```tsx
<WalletButton.Custom wallet="rainbow">
  {({ ready, connect }) => {
    return (
      <button
        type="button"
        disabled={!ready}
        onClick={connect}
      >
        Connect Rainbow
      </button>
    );
  }}
</WalletButton.Custom>
```

Most dApps are best served by the [ConnectButton](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/connect-button). Reference the docs [here](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/wallet-button) for more information about `WalletButton` adoption and usecases.
